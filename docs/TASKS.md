# Tasks

> **Persistent task tracker.** Lives in `docs/`. Progress syncs to PROJECT_STATE.md.

## Backlog
<!-- Ideas and future work. Added by /interview, user input, or discovered during development. -->
<!-- Priority: top = highest, bottom = lowest -->

_(empty — Themes shipped 2026-06-13; see tasks-archive.md)_

## Current Sprint
<!-- Active work. Populated by /plan or /execute. Keep focused (3-7 tasks). -->
<!-- When done: /log moves to tasks-archive.md -->

_(empty — pick the next feature with `/plan`)_

---

## Progress Calculation

```
Sprint Progress = checked in Current Sprint / total in Current Sprint
Overall Progress = (archived count + checked) / (backlog + current + archived)
```

Archived task count is read from `tasks-archive.md` header.
